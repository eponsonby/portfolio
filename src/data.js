        "Erin has been the consummate professional during our time working together. She successfully replaced her predecessor with no loss of quality by the overall project team. She was able to become well-versed on a highly visible software product, to the point where she was able to serve as Product Owner when needed. Erin’s product knowledge, initiative, commitment to quality, and overall professionalism was critical to our project team receiving a 5 (out of 5)-star rating for the project. Erin Ponsonby’s performance exemplifies her dedication, focus, and perseverance. I would work with her on any project without hesitation.",

In every situation, Erin has shown strong leadership, dedication and a knack for creative problem solving. Her exceptional analytical skills coupled well with her interpersonal communication skills make her an exceptional leader. She would be a huge asset to any team she joins.",
